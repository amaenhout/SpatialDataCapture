		<h5>Street names tell us much about the urban environment, both past and present - its history, its landscape, its people, its aspirations, its self-image. </h5><p> People in power determined who or what was worth remembering and forgetting. As places change over time, street names thus become poor representations of the contemporary environment. This emphasises the delicate balance between representing the past and the present.</p>
		<p>Detailed analyses and data visualisations of street toponymics are helpful to reveal historical socio-cultural contexts of places, that may not be obvious in the present. For example, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kvetoslava_Matlovicova/publication/277464395_The_Possibilities_for_Analysing_Street_Names_in_Relation_to_the_Space_and_Identity_Case_Study_of_Slovak_Cities/links/556af2d008aefcb861d60b4e/The-Possibilities-for-Analysing-Street-Names-in-Relation-to-the-Space-and-Identity-Case-Study-of-Slovak-Cities.pdf?origin=publication_detail">Bucher et al. (2013)</a> conducted a statistical case study of Slovak cities, which found that street names were mainly named after people in occupations related to art, culture and politics. Additionally, such projects help to challenge the status quo, for example in the gendered politics of place. Many countries in Western Europe tend to have male-dominated street names, highlighting the environment built upon the historical subservience of women (<a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17203823>Bosworth, 2012</a>). In Rotterdam, 92% of the streets named after people are named after white men, a representation distant from the present diversity (<a href="https://www.citymetric.com/fabric/paris-amsterdam-and-brussels-feminists-are-campaigning-name-more-streets-after-women-4137">Franssen, 2018</a>). </p>
		<br/>
		<h5><p>These stories led us to ask: what are the main themes and types of people that streets in Western Europe are named after, and how are they distributed across the region and within each country?</p>
		</h5>

		<br/>
		<p>Two projects in particular helped us refine our project's objectives and approach. <a href="http://www.citylab.com/politics/2015/11/mapping-the-sexism-of-city-street-names/414094/">Poon (2015)</a> collaborated with Mapbox to visualise the gulf between male and female street names in 7 metropolitan cities. Their comparisons across metropolitan areas motivated us to expand our scope to visualise a variety of scales. Additionally, <a href="https://www.zeit.de/feature/streetdirectory-streetnames-origin-germany-infographic-english">Biermann et al. (2018)</a> compiled a database of Germanyâ€™s street names to generate a static graphical and map visualisation of the regional distribution of common names. This project inspired our use of a hexagonal layer to represent an independent and neutral geographical unit of analysis. However, we sought to produce an interactive website with a wider representation of themes, paying attention to places that had not been researched before.  </p>
